- make the tables capable of referencing *one* cmap and reversed
  cmap. this will allow for the cmap to change in applications
  that would need such a thing.

Not yet supported:
GSUB Lookup Type 8 (Reverse Chaining Context)
LookupFlag.RightToLeft
GDEF.AttachList
GDEF.LigCaretList
DFLT/dflt language tags
GPOS Lookup Types 5 & 6 may be, and probably are, buggy.

Skipped:
- should the glyph width be calculated into the glyph record's
  x-advance before returning it to the caller?
  - no. that is the responsibility of a render.
- need to handle featureRecord.FeatureParams if they exist (fontTools does not read these)
- make rand feature support smarter. look back through the
  processed glyphs and find the alternate that has occurred
  least frequently and farthest away. (this was skipped because
  the rand feature is not such a good idea to begin with)
